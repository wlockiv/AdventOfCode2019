# Advent Of Code 2019 Solutions

This repo contains my **Python3.8** solutions to the Advent of Code 2019 Challenges.

## Narrative

Santa has become stranded at the edge of the Solar System while delivering presents to other planets! To accurately calculate his position in space, safely align his warp drive, and return to Earth in time to save Christmas, he needs you to bring him measurements from fifty stars.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

## Instructions

You will need to run each module individually, so use the following in your terminal:

```shell script
python3 adventofcode2019/day01/part1.py
python3 adventofcode2019/day01/part2.py
```

...and so on. I plan on avoiding dependencies for the challenges themselves, so you should not need to spin up your own environment to run the code.

You may find each day's narrative (with answers) in the README.md files in their respective folders.
