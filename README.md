# Advent Of Code 2019 Solutions

This repo contains my **Python3.8** solutions to the Advent of Code 2019 Challenges.

## Narrative

Santa has become stranded at the edge of the Solar System while delivering presents to other planets! To accurately calculate his position in space, safely align his warp drive, and return to Earth in time to save Christmas, he needs you to bring him measurements from fifty stars.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

## Instructions

There are two ways that you may run each of the tests.

### 1. Manually in Terminal

You will manually spin up each python script so that they run as "main".

For example:

```shell script
python3 adventofcode2019/day01/part1.py
python3 adventofcode2019/day01/part2.py
```

...and so on. I plan on avoiding dependencies for the challenges themselves, so you should not need to build an virtualenv.

### 2. Using the helper

To run the solution for a specific day and part:

```shell script
python3 aoc2019.py --day 1 --part 1 
python3 aoc2019.py -d 1 -p 2
```

To run all parts for a day

```shell script
python3 aoc2019.py --day 1
python3 aoc2019.py -d 1
```

Of course, you can always use the `--help` option for reference!

## Finally

You may find each day's narrative (with answers) in the README.md files in their respective folders.
